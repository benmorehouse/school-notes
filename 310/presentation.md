# Economic discrimination: transgender discrimination

### First Reading -> Re Estate of 

The legislature has declared that the public policy of this state is to recognize only the
traditional marriage between two parties who are of the opposite sex.

The words "sex," "marriage," "male," and "female" in everyday understanding do not
encompass transsexuals. The common, ordinary meaning of "persons of the opposite sex"
contemplates what is commonly understood to be a biological man and a biological woman. A
post-operative male-to-female transsexual does not fit the common definition of a female. 

The stated purpose of K.S.A. 2001 Supp. 23-101 and K.S.A. 2001 Supp. 23-115 is to
recognize that only traditional marriages are valid in this state. A post-operative 
male-tofemale transsexual is not a woman within the meaning of the statutes and cannot validly
marry another man.

J'Noel was born a male
Marshall was a businessman in northeast Kansas who had accumulated some wealth. He had
one son, Joe, from whom he was estranged. Marshall's wife had died some time before he met
J'Noel. There is no evidence that Marshall was not competent.

J'Noel underwent surgery, then went to colleges, jobs, state, everything to get her gendered as female
on papers in wisconsin.

Marshall dies, and his son goes to the courts and says that he's the soul heir to his father's estate, because
the marriage wasn't legit because J'Noel was born a man.
On cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court denied J'Noel's motion by declining
to give full faith and credit to J'Noel's Wisconsin birth certificate, which had been amended as
to sex and name.

How it was judged
---

On the question of validity of the marriage of a post-operative transsexual, there
are two distinct "lines" of cases. One judges validity of the marriage according to the sexual
classification assigned to the transsexual at birth. The other views medical and surgical
 [*196] procedures as a means of unifying a divided sexual identity and determines the
transsexual's sexual classification for the purpose of marriage at the time of marriage. The
essential difference between the two approaches is the latter's crediting a mental component,
as well as an anatomical component, to each person's sexual identity. 

Littleton was the source for the district court's language and reasoning. The Texas court's
statement of the issue was: "Can a physician change the gender of a person with a scalpel,
drugs and counseling, or is a person's gender immutably fixed by our Creator at birth?" 9
S.W.3d at 224. For what purported to be its findings of fact, the district court restated the
Texas court's conclusions nearly verbatim (See 9 S.W.3d at 230-31): 

"Through surgery and hormones, a transsexual male can be made to look like a woman,
including female genitalia and breasts. Transsexual medical treatment, however, does not
create the internal sexual organs of a woman, except for the vaginal canal. There is no womb,
cervix or ovaries in the post-operative transsexual female."

QUESTION: Then given the internal limitations, when science catches up, how will this change the
viewpoint of this legal note?

In some other cases:
"In M.T., a husband and wife were divorcing, and the issue was support and maintenance. The
husband argued that he should not have to pay support to his wife because she was a
male, [***15] making the marriage void. The issue before the court, similar to that before
this court, was whether the marriage of a post-operative male-to-female transsexual and a
male was a lawful marriage between a man and a woman. The court found that it was a valid
marriage. 140 N.J. Super. at 90. 

--> since the wife was a woman at marriage, the man was obligated to support her.

The court then started to look at past cases in this context:
The cases generally fall into three categories: cases dealing with the amendment of
identification records, usually birth certificate name and/or sex changes; cases dealing with
discrimination, most pointedly in the workplace; and cases dealing with marriage between a
transsexual and a nontranssexual. An additional case which will be discussed deals with
transsexuals and competition in sporting events. The analysis will follow the cases
chronologically. 

The transsexual's application in Weiner was denied. In a resolution passed by the Board of
Health, it was stated that '"'an individual born one sex cannot be changed for the reasons
proposed by the request which was made to us. Sex can be changed where there is an error,
of course, but not when there is a later attempt to change psychological orientation of the
patient and including such surgery as goes

"The court found that biological sex is determined at birth and cannot be changed by natural
or surgical means. The respondent's operation, the court stated, cannot affect the true sex.
The only cases where the term 'change of sex' is appropriate, the court opined, is when there
has been a mistake as to sex at birth that is subsequently revealed in a medical examination.

'In our opinion, it is at least equally, if not more reasonable, to assume that in enacting these
statutes it was the intent of the legislature of Oregon that a "birth certificate" is an historical
record of the facts as they existed at the time of birth, subject to the specific [***31]
exceptions provided by statute.' 277 Ore. at 375.
"In so finding, the Supreme Court declared that 'it is not for this court to decide which view is
preferable. On the contrary, we hold that this is a matter of public policy to be decided by the
Oregon legislature.' 277 Ore. at 376. 

*** Interesting ***
Point of the court in oregon is essentially saying that the birth certificate is critically a document
to explain the time at birth who they were and what gender they were. Is someone is transgender later in
life then that gender when they are born? What does it mean to transition then? What if we have a birth certicate that
doesn't state gender, and then a dynamic "sex" card that states the sex, similar to a drivers license.

Is it more important to fight the process of redoing birth certificates, or to redefine the implications of the birth certificate itself.

The court explained that the words of Title VII do not outlaw discrimination
against a person who has a sexual identity disorder. It noted that the law clearly prohibits
discrimination against women because [**130] they are women or men because they are
men; it does not protect a person born with a male body who believes himself to be female or
a person born with a female body who believes herself to be male. 

The biggest case used in all of this was:

"Christie had a name and sex change made on her birth certificate during pendency of the
suit. During the surgical procedures, Christie's penis, scrotum, and testicles were removed,
and a vagina and labia were constructed. Christie also had breast construction surgery. One of
Christie's doctors testified that Christie 'has the capacity to function sexually as a female' after
the surgery. 9 S.W.3d at 225. Doctors testified that medically Christie was a woman.

"The court in Littleton stated that in Texas, marriage must be between two parties of the
opposite sex. 9 S.W.3d at 225. Further, in order for Christie to sue under the wrongful death
statute in Texas, Christie must be the surviving spouse. 9 S.W.3d at 225

The texas law states a lot that: We cannot make law when no law exists: we can only interpret the written
word of our sister branch of government, the legislature

*** Interesting ***
Question, when does law get made then in something like this? Ignorance shouldn't mean bliss in line with 
law making.

One wrote that he believed Kevin's "'brain sex or mental sex is male,'"
and then stated his agreement with the opinion of Milton Diamond, an American professor of
anatomy and reproductive biology, "'that further research will confirm the present evidence
that brain sex or mental sex is a reality which would explain the persistence of a gender
identity in the face of or contrary to external influences.'"

The
district court relied entirely on the Texas court's opinion in Littleton for the "facts" on which it
based its conclusion of law. There were no expert witnesses or medical testimony as to
whether J'Noel was a male or female.

The Court of Appeals rejected the district court's sex-at-birth-answers-the-question rationale
in part, at least, because the Court of Appeals opined that there are a number of factors that
make sexual identification at birth less than certain. In chromosomal sex disorders, the
chromosomal pattern does not fit into the XX and XY binary system. Among the chromosomal
sex disorders described by Greenberg are Klinefelter Syndrome, which affects approximately 1
in 500 to 1,000 babies identified at birth as males based on the appearance of external
genitalia, in which multiple X chromosomes may become manifest in puberty with breast
development. Turner Syndrome affects babies identified at birth as females, [***45] who in
fact typically have only one X chromosome. As a result, a person with Turner Syndrome will
have female appearing genitalia but may have unformed and nonfunctioning gonads. What the
district court said about J'Noel, that "there is no womb, cervix or ovaries," also could be true
for a person with Turner Syndrome who had been identified as a female at birth.

Sex Discrimination, Gender Identity and Title VII: No Limits, or New Boundaries?

The appellate court concluded further that Eastern had not discriminated against Ulane because 
she was a female, but because she was a transsexual — “a biological male who takes female hormones,
cross-dresses, and has surgically altered parts of her body to make it appear to be female.” 
Therefore, because Title VII did not prohibit discrimination against transsexuals, the trial court’s
determination was reversed and the Seventh Circuit entered judgment in favor of Eastern.

 In other words, these courts have treated discrimination against transsexuals as discrimination 
 on grounds that their behavior or appearance did not conform to societal stereotypes for their 
 biological sex.

After Price Waterhouse, an employer who discriminates against women because, for instance, they 
do not wear dresses or makeup, is engaging in sex discrimination because the discrimination would 
not occur but for the victim’s sex. It follows that employers who discriminate against men because 
they do wear dresses and makeup, or otherwise act femininely, are also engaging in sex discrimination, 
because the discrimination would not occur but for the victim’s sex.

TL;DR: It starts off with how in Ulaine vs Eastern Airlines, they said that what the airlines did was 
okay because they discriminated based on being transgender, not male or female. But the interpretation 
developed into that of discriminating based on someone being gender is sexual discrimination because
you are doing so based on that notion that they are not acting like their gender given at birth by
transitioning.
