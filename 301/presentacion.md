1940's, war era, girl and her mother. 
The daught sees fairy tails. The mother is pregnant, and goes to a captain. She tells her mother about fairytails that she sees, but
her mother brushes them off.

The captain is very sure that the baby is a boy. He's a very strict and stern man.
Captain kills the two people that come up to the compound ruthlessly in front of everyone.

The fairy ends up in the room with the kid and the mom. The fairy changes shape right in front of the girl, and becomes more human
looking and less like a bug.

The fairy tale then leads the Othelia out the room and into the woods.

Meets an older figure that "has many names", he says he's a Faun, and that he's ofelias's servant because she's a princess.
Ofelia is apparently a princess, and that there's only one portal left that allows her to exist.


Her mom really wants her to look good for the captain.

Mercedes is the character that's in charge of the house when the professor is away.

Ofelia goes and looks for a large toad in the forest while the soldiers are away investigating a fire that they saw in the woods.
There indeed is a whole group of men that's in the forest. They left a lottery ticket.

She finds the toad, which has a key to something...

The captain is fighting against mercenaries. he wants to "clean" spain and all of the people he's fighting against are republican
vs the facist regime he supports. 


She has to get all three of her tasks done for the Faun to be able to get her to her kingdonw. The moon rising as a full moon is her timeline.
The book she has shows her how her mom starts to bleed, then she opens the door and her mom is actually bleeding and dying.

Mercedes is revealed to be helping the revolutionaries that are in the woods.
Mercedes and the doctor are also working together to help them.

Her next task from the book is to take the chalk she has and to trace a door in her room, so that she can go to some other wonderland
with the faries and find something for the Faun. 
She eats one of the grapes in the room and the thing that's in there starts to eat the fairies and then comes after her.

Othelia has to put two drops of her blood on this thing underneath her mom to cure her mom, according to the book and the Faun.
Othelia promises the child that she will make the child a prince if the child doesn't kill her mom. She buys into the idea that she's
got a kingdom to herself now, and her mother is indirectly tied into some future foreshadowing.

Huge firefight in the forest, wher ethe captain realizes how the revolutionaries were able to surround and attack them: mercedes.
They bring back one prisoner, and it's pedro, mercedes' brother, who's part of the revolutionaries.

Pablo told them that he was helped.

The captain found othelia under the bed, and the bed had the thing that was helping save her mom. He removed it. 
He also found out that the doctor was helping the revolutionaries, and kills the doctor. The doctor killed pablo right before.

The mother dies from child birth.

The captain confronts mercedes about the key, but doesn't let her know that he knows. She then goes to Ophelia, saying she's leaving.
Ofelia goes with. They get caught, mercedes get's captured but stabs the captain and runs. She is surrounded by the facists, but
revolutionaries come and save her. Pablo is actually still alive. He is part of the group that comes to save mercedes.

The Faun comes to Ofelia and says to get her brother who was just born, and bring him to the Labrynth.

The captain comes, and it shows how Ofelia has been imagining this the entire time in her mind. Then the captain takes the baby, and shoots
ofelia. The captain walks out of the labrynth, is surrounded by revolutionaries, and then is killed. Mercedes has the baby at this point.

They come to ofelias body. Her blood drops into the labrynth, which satisfies the final wish from the Faun, 
which is that they needed blood from an innocent soul.

Turns out she was right with the magic all along, at least in her version of heaven. Her mother and father are there, it's where the story ends.
