# Intro

Our studies with 3 individuals immediately after they first
experienced patterned vision provided a rare opportunity to
examine the bootstrapping mechanisms for visual parsing and
the progression of visual abilities due to visual experience.

It is worth noting that working with a noninfant population
provides us with both advantages and disadvantages. On the one
hand, because the brain is otherwise almost fully mature in the
individuals we work with, visual learning can be segregated from
development of the other senses and from real-world knowledge.
On the other hand, a mature brain may not undergo the same
progression as an infant brain. Thus, it is appropriate to consider
this work as complementary to, rather than a replacement for,
traditional studies with infants.

# Procedure

Tests of Static Visual Parsing:
Our studies of static visual parsing comprised seven tests, which
assessed the subjects’ responses to images of simple shapes.a

Test of Object Recognition:
For this test, subjects were shown a set of 50 images of common
objects and were asked to name the objects they recognized. The
images were in color and had different backgrounds

Tests of Dynamic Visual Parsing
The stimuli used to test dynamic visual parsing were similar to
those in the tests of visual parsing, but incorporated motion cues.
These tests were administered at the same time as the initial
tests of static visual parsing and the recognition test.

They had no difficulty in enumerating individual geometric shapes presented by themselves or in
the presence of other shapes that were nonoverlapping (Test A).
However, when the shapes overlapped, regardless of whether the
shapes were presented as line drawings or as filled transparent
surfaces (Test B and C), the recently treated subjects’ responses
were very different from control subjects’

Given their pronounced tendency to overfragment images, we reasoned
that their ability to veridically segment and recognize real-world
images would be compromised.

They suggest that the early stages of this process are
characterized by integrative impairments. These impairments
lead to perceptual overfragmentation of images, and thus compromise recognition performance. However, the use of motion
information effectively mitigates these integrative difficulties.

Furthermore,
in these past cases, as in the present one, motion sensitivity was
evident soon after treatment
