# Procedure and goals

Wanted to see the difference between the evolution of humans and primates.

The human eye and how it works...

We briefly reported the morphological uniqueness of the human eye and discussed its
adaptive meanings. In the present paper we
fully analysed the results and examined the
following hypotheses on adaptive meanings
of primate eye morphology.

This hypothesis was examined and supported by analysing the eye movement of
video-recorded primates and comparing the
way that gaze direction changes among
species with various body sizes and habitat
types.

Our results suggested that unique features of the human eye
started to evolve as adaptations to large body
size and terrestrial life and were completed
as a device for communication using gaze
signal.

Two parameters were measured for each
species: the width/height ratio of the eye
outline (WHR) and an index of exposed
sclera size in the eye outline (SSI). Frontal
full-face images without obvious facial
expression of subjects were recorded by
video camera.

# Results

Eye size, eye movement, eye color were all measured.

Figure 2(a) shows that human eyes have the
largest exposed sclera area and show
extraordinary horizontal elongation of the
eye outline among primates.

Relationship between eye shape and visual function
----

These facts suggest that the
variation in the eye shape parameters
of each phylogenic group does not reflect
evolutionary trends in these visual functions

Relationship between body size and SSI
----

This means that species
with larger body size have a larger exposed
scleral area.

If we suppose that a larger exposed sclera
is an adaptation for extending the visual field
by eyeball movement, the correlation
between SSI and body size can be explained
by the theory of scaling.

Thus, to
save energy when changing the direction of
gaze, a large-sized species would move the
eyeball more often than a small-sized
species, and have a larger exposed scleral
area.
