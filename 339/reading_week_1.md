Invariant information is consistent across generations and within lifetimes 
(e.g., the prototypical shape of a human face) and is associated with modular brain and
cognitive systems that coalesce around the domains of folk psychology, folk
biology, and folk physics.

Variant information varies across generations and within lifetimes (e.g., as in social dynamics)

natural selection is just a means to reproduce, and who has the ecological superiority to reproduce at scale.

all species have evolved to attempt
to organize their world in ways that eliminate predatory risks and enhance survival and reproductive options

It was found that brains formed and doubled in size and volume from one generation of human to another.
The theme that runs through all of the proposals is the
human brain and mind evolved to anticipate and thus better cope with unpredictable
climatic, ecological, or social change within a lifetime.

Ecological dominance is the idea of being superior in your ecology, which is what humans came to become. This meant
that they were able to.

Once ecological dominance was achieved (perhaps with H. erectus; Geary, 2005), a
social struggle for ecological control would follow, if ecologies varied in the quantity and
quality of the resources—such as prey species, water, shelter—contained therein

# Motivation to control

Idea that we make decisions based off how we can attain social, biological and physical resources.
The thesis here and elsewhere (Geary, 1998, 2005) is that the human motivation to control is indeed an evolved disposition and is implicitly focused on attempts to
control social relationships and the behavior of other people, and to control the biological
and physical resources that have historically covaried with survival and reproductive
prospects in the local ecology

### Benefits of having control 

As I stated, the resources that covary with evolutionary outcomes fall into three categories, social, biological, and physical.
Biological resources include food and medicine, and
physical resources include the territories that contain biological resources and that support homes, agriculture, pastures, and so on. In modern societies, some resources are
symbolic (e.g., money, stocks) but are important because control of these resources enhances
social influence and facilitates control of quality foods, medicines, housing, and so forth.

By definition, despots are individuals who have considerable
social power and whose behavior is not typically constrained by affective or social consequences

Genghis Khan is an extreme example of someone getting the benefits of control. man literally had a million children, and 8% of china

Benefits of control also spanned to the commonwealth. People would 

In preindustrial and industrializingWestern societies, and in traditional societies today
(Hill & Hurtado, 1996; United Nations, 1985), SES was considerably more important than
it currently is in Western culture (Hed, 1987; Herlihy, 1965; Morrison, Kirshner, & Molho,
1977; Schultz, 1991). In fact, parental SES often influenced which infants and young children would live and which would die. To illustrate, during the 1437–1438 and 1449–1450
epidemics in Florence, Italy, child mortality rates increased 5- to 10-fold and varied inversely
with parental SES even at the high end of the continuum (Morrison et al., 1977).As another
example, in an extensive analysis of birth, death, and demographic records from 18th century Berlin, Schultz found a strong correlation (r  .74) between parental SES and infant
and child mortality rates. Infant (birth to 1 year) mortality rates were about 10% for aristocrats but more than 40% for laborers and unskilled technicians

To summary:
In most human
societies and presumably throughout hominid evolution, gaining social influence and
control of biological and physical resources, that is, food, medicine, shelter, land, and so
forth, covaried with reproductive opportunity (i.e., choice of mating partner or partners),
reproductive success (i.e., offspring survival to adulthood), and survival prospects. A
fundamental motivation to control has evolved in humans, because success at achieving
control of social, biological, and physical resources very often meant the difference between
living and dying.

### Control-related mechanisms

Conscious-Psychological Systems. The core conscious-psychological mechanism presented in Figure 1 is an explicit mental representation of situations that are centered on
the self and one’s relationship with other people or one’s access to biological and physical
resources that are of significance in the culture and ecology in which the person is situated. 
Of central importance is the ability to create a mental representation of a desired or fantasized state.
This mental representation serves as a goal to be achieved!

When people fail, they'll make attributions about why they failed so that they can inch closer to the mental representation that they have, vs further from it. 
conflict is invariably over resource control.

There can also be attributions driven by hostility, as in a group of people stopped you from reaching your mental representation/you stopped osmeone else.

### Cognitive systems

working memory, attentional control, and the ability to inhibit automatic processing of folk-related information or inhibit evolved behavioral reactions to this information
These cognitive and problem-solving processes are the mechanisms that allow individuals to
mentally represent and manipulate information processed by sensory and perceptual systems (e.g., sounds, and words), and the more complex forms of information processed by
the social, biological, and physical modules.

these cognitive and problem-solving mechanisms and the generation and manipulation of
conscious-psychological representations. In other words, working memory and attentional and inhibitory control are the content-free mechanisms that, for instance, enable
the integration of a current conscious-psychological state with memory representations
of related past experiences

This is how you reflect on something and come up with the things that you come up with. You use memory as well as your Conscious-Psychological Systems to create a mental representation of what 
you want or should thinnk about a situation.

### Affective Systems

Emotions
The associated emotions provide feedback to other individuals (e.g., a frown may automatically signal disapproval)
and feelings provide feedback to the individual (Campos, Campos, & Barrett, 1989).

Positive and negative affects are also
important mechanisms that regulate social dynamics and interactions. For instance, negative affect is predicted to be evoked when other people attempt to influence your behavior for their own motivation-to-control ends, if your behavior is not in your own self-interest.

(e.g., the amygdala) should function, in part, to amplify attention to evolutionarily significant forms of information

### Brain Systems

I propose that self-awareness and other functions associated with the prefrontal cortex (e.g., executive functions) can be integrated with the motivation to control.
Specifically, the motivation to control is facilitated by the ability to mentally simulate
potential future social scenarios

Evolution has allowed for our brains to grow past what they should be as part of this motivation for control.

# Domains of the Human Mind

modularity means there are neural and perceptual systems that selectively respond to certain forms of information (e.g., shape of a face) and result in this
information being activated and organized in short-term memory. Once in short-term
memory, the information is made available for representation in working memory. Once
in working memory, the individual becomes explicitly aware of this information, but this
is only the end point of a serious of implicit processes.

### Functional Taxonomy of the Human Min

As an example, the formation of friendships is supported by folk-psychological competencies, but does not, on the surface,
appear to be guided by a motivation to control the behavior of these people. At the very
least, there is often no explicit, conscious desire to do so. However, the development of
these relationships and the associated social support are correlated with physical and
psychological health and in some contexts mortality risks

Folk psych modules
----
There are three types of folk psych modules: These direct attention toward and process social information related to the self,
other individuals, and group formation

Folk bio modules
----
folk-biological modules support the ability to develop taxonomies of other species
and very elaborate knowledge systems about the behavior, growth pattern, and “essence”
of these species

Folk physics modules
-------
The folk-physical systems support navigation, the formation of mental representations of physical
features of the ecology, and the construction of tools.
The evolution of this ability almost certainly contributed to the achievement
of ecological dominance.

Bounded Rationality and Heuristics
-----
Bounding rationality goes around the idea of being rational about your situtation. Sometimes you will settle with someone for reproduction, vs 
always looking for the perfect match.


Control-related psych mechanisms: The level of actual resources is
important but, in addition, one’s position in the social hierarchy influences and is influenced by physical health, lifespan, and conscious-psychological functioning
the lowest income group with a high sense of control showed
levels of health and well-being comparable with the higher income groups.” Control over
daily events is correlated with a number of physiological and health-related outcomes

when you lose your motivation to control, it's going to come at the cost of perhaps other events.


# Social Cognitition

### Self and Others

The reality of social cognition is a mix of implicit and explicit
processes that we are only beginning to understand

The self-schema is a long-term memory network of information that links
together knowledge and beliefs about the self

For instance, when evaluating the competencies of others, people focus
on attributes that are central features of their self-schema, and prefer relationships with
others who provide feedback consistent with the self-schema.
Another potentially important feature of self-schemas is the ideal self.
Anyone aspiring to become
a research scientist, chief executive officer, or any other socially-valued position that
requires long-term effort must engage in the process of looking at current and future and making heavy analysis on the subjects.

person schemas are an important folk-psychological module. These are constructed for familiar people and people who can influence one’s life

It seems likely that the person schema will also be highly integrated with the folk-psychology
modular competencies related to others, such as theory of mind (Adolphs, 1999; Frith & Frith,
1999; Leslie, 1987). This would include memories and trait information about how the other
person typically makes inferences (e.g., tends to attribute hostile intentions to others, the
hostile attribution bias), responds to social cues, their social and other goals, and so forth.

The person schema is also related to the
use of mental simulations—called the simulation heuristic—to make judgments about how
the person might react in various situations.
It is easier to imagine—mentally simulate the
dynamics—a socially warm friend making a good impression when first meeting your family than it is to imagine the same outcome with an emotionally distant friend.

### Groups

one consequence of the achievement of ecological dominanceisincreased social competition
Under conditions in which a groups’status or resources are threatened by the activities
or perceived hostileintentions of other groups,the basictendency of humansto formin-groups
and out-groups and processinformation about members ofthese groupsin waysthat are favorably biased toward the in-group and negatively biased against the out-group is exacerbated

out-group members may automatically and unconsciously trigger negative feelings (presumably fear) in many people

## Linking motivational control

In other words, the nervous system evolved and gained
in complexity during the species’ evolutionary history, because it enabled the animal to
engage in the types of behaviors that increased survival and reproductive prospects.

The motivation to control captures the focus of this joint point in that it organizes
the ultimate function of behavior—and other adaptations (e.g., bipedal locomotion)—as
being focused on gaining access to and control of the forms of social, biological, and
physical resources that have improved survival and reproductive options during the species’ evolutionary history. The brain and mind evolved to enable animals to engage the
social world and the ecology in which they are situated and attempt to behaviorally
control essential resources.

evolution has resulted in behavioral systems that will be biased to invest time and
energy in gaining control of the specific forms of social (e.g., mates, social allies), biological (e.g., prey species, edible plants), and physical (e.g., nesting sites, water) resources
that covaried with survival or reproductive outcomes during the species’ evolutionary
history.
