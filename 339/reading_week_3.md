# Intro

The experiment where the children try to climb over the side.

The experiment thus
demonstrated that most human infants
can discriminate depth as soon as they
can crawl. 

Evidently infants should not be left close to a
brink, no matter how well they may
discriminate depth. 

No goat or lamb
ever stepped onto the glass of the deep
side, even at one day of age. When one
of these animals was placed upon the
glass on the deep side, it displayed characteristic stereotyped behavior. 


Cats, like rats, are nocturnal animals,
sensitive to tactual cues from their
vibrissae. But the cat, as a predator, must
rely more strongly on its sight. Kittens
proved to have excellent depth-discrimination.

On the visual cliff one might expect an
aquatic turtle to respond to the reHections from the glass as it might to
water and so prefer the deep side. They
showed no such preference: 76 per cent
of the aquatic turtles crawled off the
board on the shallow side. The relatively large minority that choose the
deep side suggests either that this turtle
has poorer depth-discrimination than
other animals, or that its natural habitat
gives it less occasion to "fear" a fall. 

The conclusion is that infants, as well as other animals, were able to perceive depth as
soon as they could crawl. It's not something that they are born with.
No chick, lamb or kid crossed to the deep side. When the deep side 
was suddenly lowered, the animals froze into a defensive position.
