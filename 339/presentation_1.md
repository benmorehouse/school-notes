### Presentation about the slides from start to finish by prof Tang

# Part 1

The dance of death: black plague. Killed a shit ton of people. 50-70% of population.
Grim Reaper came from this shit.

We want to contrast the black plague to the spanish flu. Personification to death.
This all originated in east asia, but went to europe because of trade. Perhaps its the fleas on the rats, but modern tech
showed that it's a bacteria.

Modern tech is kicking ass now. December 2019, We Len Yioung warned us about the Covid Pandemic. First doctor in china to alert us
of sars-covid-2.
We compare to the black death, whatever it's nothing. 

How did we get to this point? We are talking about knowledge, we have ways to take knowledge and run with it.
John Locke -> Empericist way of thinking. Tabula rausa, the mind is a blank slate where you build and reflect on your experiences.

Immanuel Kant -> Nativism... experience is important but there's also the notion that we come to the world with some sorts of things.

Which experience best explains the origin of the mind?

Humans vs other animals: all animals are born with stuff. Humans are different, they have the abolity to have culture.

In order to study adult humans, we can study them through different sources because adult humans are just too complicated.
- We study babies because we want to see where we start from a blank state.
- We study animals so that we can take them out of the context of what it means to be a complex ass human
- Other cultures -> what is a cultural difference where what's something that's different just based on society.

Humans and monkeys have different faces. Adults are better at determining diff in human faces whereas babies know diff in monkey faces better
because when we get older, we learn to prune off stuff that's not as important. Babies have so much baby potential!

A chicken doesn't know anything so we thought. Chickens and other things can have the abolity to show us evolutionary inate knowledge about 
stuff like the world. This goes back to Kant and knowledge.

Encephalization Quotient => Ratio of brain size to body size.

Motivation to control -> 

# Part 2

Eyes light and action.

Tree of evolution -> where we first came from from little bacteria to monkeys to humans with thoughts and feelings. Eventually 
you need to see so we evolutioned to have them.
The human mind needed vision to survive, reproduce, and gain ecological superiority.

Properties of light is that it can reflect, transmit through something, absorb and scatter the light.

We only see a very small part of the spectrum of color.

The sclera is the white of your eyes. 
Light comes through the lense, then goes on the lens. 
The center of the stuff will go to the fovea. 
Cornea - film over your eyes that protects it. If you damage it, ur fucked.

Photorecptors! They are very prevelant throughout your retina. Your blind spot is where the nerves all join together.
We can detect color through wavelengths.

Your color visiion is best when you look at something directly.

Development of vision: when ur born, you are blind as shit. but by 12 months you see things relatively clear.
Transmission from the eye to the brain.

Striate Cortex is where everything gets taken. then you have v2 which routes to everything else. Then v3 v4 v5 locations.

Human field of vision for animals vs rabbits. Horses have insane vision. Humans have the most limited field of vision. Octopus also have 
really interesting eyes. One eye has a lot mroe connecting to the brain.

Humans have white in their eyes because of the social queues and evolutionary traits.

Processing landscapes -> 
Processsing faces -> always look at the eyes nose and mouth.
Animals look at bright things.


# Part 3

Physics! Color is existant because of wavelenths and their frequency.

Photorecptors are cones and rods that take in images and convert them to 

We have 3 diff types of Photorecptors
Blue  -> Short wavelengths
Green  -> Medium wavelenghts
Red -> Long wavelenths

Single Cone Response -> you have parabola of where this specific neuron will fire. This is why we have 3 different cones, is because
then 

Human cone mosaic, says we have mostly green and red photorecptors. 
Monkeys have 

Photopigments in primates

Color deficiencies happen:
- lack of blue  tritanopia is lack of blue photorecptors
- "" green
- "" red
- normal vision

Chromatic Assimilation: when things look like the colors that are next to them.
Chomatic induction: when things contrast the colors that are next to them.

Linguistic relativity hypothesis is the fancy way of saying language and thought are intertwined.

Russian Blue experiment.

Language and color perception. If you are from more towards the equator, then you see blue in a different way.
Munsell color chart is commonly used for color detection and to tell if you are color blind.

Is color perception needed. Correct answer is yes! for stuff like food, etc.

# Part 4

Space perception 
it's much harder than we think!
Artificial intelligence is not able toi replicate our visual stuff.

Visual illusions can happen pretty easily.

Monocular depth cuees are just about how far things are from each other and being able to tell that.
	- Interposition: look at something and able to tell the depth based on relating it to sopmething else.
	- Linear Perspective: lose depth based on 

Binocular depth cue is just about how your eyes use each other to be able to tell how far away something is. If you throw a baseball
at someone and they've got one eye closed, it will be really hard to tell how far away it is for them.

Mechanisms that lead to interpretation:
Two possibilities: 
	1. humans have the special ability to understand the core knowledge of space
		Rene Descartes..... nativism... u can naturally infer through geometry
		cartesian system creator!
	2. humans have learned about space 
		George berkely...  we just learn things as we go. empiricist.
		Learn through touch

Empiricst Theory of space perception: more effort to look close vs looking at something further away. If we touch something, we can learn
more about something and where it's at/how far it is from us.

Then we tested it!

Molyneux's question to Locke: will a blind person be able to see all of a sudden if they touch things and then open their eyes and can
see what they see.

Experience matters when it comes to seeing stuff!

Case study: SB -> Couldn't see and then was able to see, but even after 3 months was able to see.
Lost sight in both eyes, didn't see anything after 3 months. This is no support for nativism or empiricms because they also
just never learned.

Case Study: SD -> born blind but then at 12 could see, then 20 years later they learn. This supports emrpiricsm

Problem is that we need to study this with newborns to get rid of the variables that adults bring to the table.
Edge test!

Helmholtz: Adults learn to perceive space correctly. We adapt.
		If not adaption occurs, then we aren't able to adjust.
		Goggle test -> your arm just learned to tap the dot. This is tactile. Goggle test just shows how the tactile
		has the ability to impact vision.

# Part 5

The celebreties

Ants, bees, chicks, rodents

Three core navigation patterns.

Ants just look at the son and do path integration. Direction of travel is based on sun and also how much they traveled. They covered the eyes
of the ants, they were not able to get back, but when they take the fucking ants legs, it gets back just fine still. 

Other ways to convert distance:
Bees use optic queues, they use landmarks. Bee movie was really spot on. They also talk with each other and work with each other.
The ants aren't as good as bees. The longer the ant goes, the less they have the ability to get home.

You can also navigate through maps. Representations are like photographs.

Bees do snapshots, because they need to know how to get around where they are. This is called a view dependent representation, where they
use photos to tell where they are and where they go.

Navigate via external queues.

Free roaming vs blocked access
