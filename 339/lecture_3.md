Space Perception
================

Visual system evolved to solve problems about how we see things. Things aren't choppy when someone does something.

Perception appears to be immediate and effortless

Object Motion
	when u are staying still, but something is move
Observer Motion
	When u are moving and somethin is staying still -=> this requires problem solving and is very complex for the individual

We have a core knowledge of space and how the world is structured. This is a nativism perspective.
It is something that we are born with? -> special purpose cognitive system

Or are we born with the capacity to learn about our surroundings, and then can construct our way of how the world is -> general purpose
This is the empericism perspective.

Nativist theory of space perception
Rene Descartes is a famous math dude that formed the cartesian coordinate system.

The Observer 
	Determine visual angles
	Muscular response in our eyes allows us to make a geometric calculation, and then say "this object is xyz distance from me", etc.
	Mind and brain are built to perceive space
	Geometric inferences and perceptual processes like reasoning

George Berkeley disagreed, said that there's more effort being put in when  -> empiricism and associativism
Mind and brain built to sense stuff well beforehand. No reasoning in order to do what we do. Learn to interpret stimuloi

# so how do we test this?

Touch to visual gives you a huge increase in understanding an object, which shows that the Observer idea is more correct.
