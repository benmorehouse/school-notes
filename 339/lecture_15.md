# Lecture 15

The ratio of not understanding numbers declines with age. Could be caused by:
	- Experience with symbolic number counting, math education
	- Maturation and non-specific experience such as counting stuff, etc. You build intuition as you grow

Habituation of sounds also can decrease the ratio because as they hear a musical note more and more, they become less and less interested.

Can Babies add? for example 5+5=?
We tested this with a video that shows 5 objects falling down, then 5 coming from the side. Then there's an occluder that comes and 
blocks the 5 objects. 

With something surprising happens, babies look for longer. Babies were unsurprised by the addition and subtraction with the occluder.

Before babies learn counting or arithmetic, infants represent and understand large numerical magnitudesm which means they can discriminate 8 and 16.
When they are 9months old they can discriminate 8 and 12

Their number representations are approximate and show a signature ratio limit

infants show the same sort of understanding about counting and this ratio we are talking about to things like objects and sounds

----

We looked at this same sort of thing in non-humans -> rats

The same thing happens in rats where the ratio decreases as the number of presses they see increases
