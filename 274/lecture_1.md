Stats is a science, and science is the study of evidence-based reflection.
For something that's 

When you sample, you try to do it somewhat randomly otherwise you are not getting random data that can actually 
give an accurate representation of information. Your conclusion isn't going to match.

Finding a good match between what you are trying to figure out, as well as doing so randomly through the population,
is very critical. 

Descriptive Statistics: describe single sample of data.
Let's say you want to describe the height of the class. You would do so by sampling a single variable from everyone
that's in the class.

Mean: average
Median: middle number
Mode: repeats => there are no modes if there are no repeats.
	Mode is meaningful to understand when you are studying something non-numerical

The way that we anaylze data depends on the type of data that we get

Data types
---
1. Nominal data => anytime you have something that makes things different, numbers etc
2. Ordinal data -> first, second, third. But can never know actual piece of data
3. Interval data ->  Interval data, also called an integer, is defined as a data type 
			which is measured along a scale, in which each point is placed at equal distance from one another.
4. Ratio -> The numbers mean something, but also look at the other data points in order to draw conclusions.

You want to describe the central tendency of the data set. The way to make this happen is by checking to make sure.
