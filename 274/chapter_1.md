Descriptive Statistics is used to summarize some study that people read about.
	Normally means that data is given in graphs and tabular form

Inferntial statistics is used to make an actionable decision about something based on statistics.
	Mostly used when you don't have access to the entire population, and instead can only take a small amount

Statistics is a branch of mathematics used to summarize, analyze, and interpret a group of numbers or observations.

1.2
-----

datata (plural) are a set of scores, measurements, or observations that are typically numeric. 
A datum (singular) is a single measurement or observation.

Population parameter is what u use to pick data out of your population. You won't pick all people at usc, maybe just new north people
for instance. 

You can also take just a sample of people out of the population regardless of parameter.

Experimential methods

1. Experiment -> run an experiment to make data. Isolates cause and effect
	Must have Manipulation of variables, randomization of population, comparison/control
	Independent Variable: something that's consistent but being manipulated, meaning it's purely being changed 
	and we watch the reaction to this change.
	Dependent Variable: the variable that fluctuates due to the independent variable being changed
Operational definition is the description of some event in terms of its variables.

Quasi Experimental method is when one of two things happens: 
	- No control group
	- variables aren't manipulated
In a typical quasi-experiment, the variables being studied cannot be manipulated, which makes random assignment impossible.
A preexisting variable, or one to which participants cannot be randomly assigned, is called a quasi-independent variable.
Gender is an example of a prexisting variable that can't be manipulated amongst test subjects.

Correlational Method
Another method for examining the relationship between variables is to measure pairs of scores for each individual. 
This method can determine whether a relationship exists between variables, but it lacks the 
appropriate controls needed to demonstrate cause and effect. It doesn't change variables, it just looks at
data and compares one subject to the next.

Scales of measurement
nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio to classify scales of measurement (Stevens, 1946).
In all, scales of measurement are characterized by three properties: order, difference, and ratio.
Order: Does a larger number indicate a greater value than a smaller number? 
Difference: Does subtracting two numbers represent some meaningful value? 
Ratio: Does dividing (or taking the ratio of) two numbers represent some meaningful value?

Nominal variables
	Stuff like social security numbers, ID's in a table, etc. This could also mean codes for 
	seasons, gender, etc.
	Coding is the way of taking stuff like entries and coding them to have an ID in say a SQL table.

Ordinal variables
	Something that simple can show more or less in terms of numbers. 
	Stuff like finishing first, second, third, etc
	They convey order or rank

Interval Variables
	Equidistant scales and no true zero value.
	Common example is rating something on a scale of 1-10. This uses what's called an equidistant scale.
	This thing also doesn't have a true zero.
	Another common example is temperature. This has no true zero, and scale is the same across the board.

Ratio variables
	Exactly like interval variables, but there exists a true zero.
	Examples are measures of length, height, etc

Types of variables

Continuous variables: you can clock someone running to the nearest 100000th of a second. It's continuous.
Discrete variables: measured in whole units or ranks. Number of siblings you have for instance is always
	going to be something that's a whole number, etc.

Quantitative variables: Continuous and discrete variables fall under this.
	It's merely measured with numeric units.

Qualitative variables: 
For example, socioeconomic class (working class, middle class, upper class) is discrete and qualitative; 
so are many behavioral disorders such as categories of depression (unipolar, bipolar) and drug use (none, experimental, abusive).

Researching all of this and using it as tools
(1) Quantitative measures are more common in behavioral research, and 
(2) most statistical tests taught in this book are adapted for quantitative measures.
