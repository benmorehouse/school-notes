Measuring variability

4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4
-------------------

Variability is a measure of the dispersion or spread of scores in a distribution and ranges from 0 to +∞.
The range is the difference between the largest value and smallest value in a distribution.

Quartiles and interquartiles
Fractiles are measures that divide data sets into two or more equal parts. The median is one example of 
a fractile because the median splits data in half or into two equal parts. Other fractiles include quartiles,
deciles, and percentiles, which split data into 4 parts, 10 parts, and 100 parts, respectively.

The interquartile range (IQR) is the range of values between the upper (Q3) and lower (Q1) quartiles of a data set.
The semi-interquartile range (SIQR) or quartile deviation is a measure of half the distance between the upper quartile

Degrees of freedom talks about how many points in a sample size can deviate. It's always the sample size - 1, because the deviation
has to start somewhere.

Population variance: Sum of each squared deviation divided by the population.
Deviation is the difference of each square and the mean.

Sample variation: same formula as population variance, but we subtract the 
denominator by 1.

Variance can be biased in a sample if the variance differs from the actual score of variance 
in the entire population. This is known as a biased estimator.

A biased estimator is any sample statistic, such as the sample variance when we divide SS by n, 
obtained from a randomly selected sample that does not equal the value of its respective population 
parameter, such as a population mean, on average.

An unbiased estimator is any sample statistic, such as the sample variance when we divide SS by n – 1, 
obtained from a randomly selected sample that equals the value of its respective population parameter, 
such as a population variance, on average.

Remember that the um of the deviations of scores from their mean is zero. 
The deviation of the first score from its mean is −1 (3 − 4 = −1), and the deviation of the second score from its mean is 0 (4 − 4 = 0).
Because all scores in a sample (n) are free to vary except one (−1), we calculate the sample variance 
by dividing SS by only those scores that are free to vary in a sample (n − 1).

The formulas for variance.

In order to find variance of a large sample, one normally has to go through and handle all the variances individually, sum them up, etc.

Insstead, you can find variance via:
	Σ x^2 - (Σx)^2 / n

Standard deviation is the square root of the variance in a population or sample.
The population standard deviation is represented by the Greek letter for a lowercase s, called sigma: σ. The sample standard deviation 
is represented by a lowercase s. In research reports, you may also see the sample standard deviation stated as SD.

The standard deviation, also called the root mean square deviation, is a measure of variability for the average distance that scores 
deviate from their mean.

The standard deviation is an estimate for the average distance that scores deviate from the mean.

These statements are often called the empirical rule. Empiricism is to observe. The name of this 
rule arises because many of the behaviors that researchers observe are approximately normally distributed.

For normal distributions with any mean and any variance, we can make the following three statements: 
- At least 68% of all scores lie within one standard deviation of the mean. 
- At least 95% of all scores lie within two standard deviations of the mean. 
- At least 99.7% of all scores lie within three standard deviations of the mean.

Characteristics of the standard deviation.

1. Always positive
2. Used for quantitative data
3. Most useful when given with the mean: 
4. The value of the SD is effected by each scre in the distribution
Adding or subtracting the same constant to or from each score will not change the value of the standard deviation.
If you double every number in a set, the S.D will be doubled. It will be divided if you divide every number.
