Probability, normal distribution, and z scores

6.1 6.2 6.3
(introduced in Chapter 4) to determine the probability of obtaining a particular outcome in 
a research study. We know, for example, that scores closer to the mean are more probable or 
likely than scores farther from the mean. In this chapter, we extend the concepts of 
probability to include situations in which we locate probabilities for scores in a normal distribution.

Normal distribution is what we are talking about. This just talks about how data has a normal curve,
and that within three standard deviations most of the data will fall.

There are characteristics that come with any normal distribution

1. Though not realistic in most studies, there's still the notion that 
normal distribution is mathematically proven.

2. Normal distribution is theoretical, but rarely do we actually see this
in practice. 

3. The mean, median and mode are all located at the 50th percentile/median quartile.

4. The normal distribution is symmetrical. The data above the mean, median, and mode is
below the mean, median & mode of the other side.
5. The mean can equal any value.
6. The standard deviation can equal any positive value.
7. The total area under the curve of a normal distribution is equal to 1.0.
8. The tails of a normal distribution are asymptotic. In a normal distribution, 
the tails are asymptotic, meaning that as you travel away from the mean the tails of the distribution are always approaching the x-axis but never touch it.

Most behavioral data approximate a normal distribution. Rarely are behavioral data exactly normally distributed.

--------------------

A z score is a value on the x-axis of a standard normal distribution. The numerical value of 
a z score specifies the distance or the number of standard deviations that a value is above or below the mean.

The numerical value of a z score specifies the distance or standard deviation of a value from the mean.
Thus, z = +1 is one standard deviation above the mean.

The standard normal transformation or z transformation is a formula used to convert any normal distribution with any 
mean and any variance to a standard normal distribution with a mean equal to 0 and a standard deviation equal to 1.

As the score of the area between mean and Z increases (gets further from the mean), the Z score increases.
