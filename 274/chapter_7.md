Probability, sampling, etc.

--------------------

In stats, they select a sample from the entire population to see what the 
overall population is like, not to tell what the specific sample is like.
We make this comparison by constructing a sampling distribution, which is a distribution of the mean and variance for all possible samples of a given size from a population.

Replacement means when you are sampling, you don't put back the subject you pulled
when you are making the sample group. eg, if you have 4 humans you are randomly selecting from,
when you make that first selection, you then only randomly select from 3 more.

Selecting a sample

Sample design: plan for how individuals will be selected from population of interest.
When sample order matters in sampling, the amount of samples possible is N ^ n

Experimential samplings means
	- order doesn't matter
	- no replacement

In experimential sampling, the equation to show the total number of samples possible is

N! / n!(N-n)!

Sampling distributions: the mean

To determine how well a sample mean estimates a population mean, we need to identify a population of interest 
and then determine the distribution of the sample means for all possible samples of a given size that can be selected from that population.

The central limit theorem explains that the shape of a sampling distribution of sample means tends 
toward a normal distribution, regardless of the distribution in the population.
From the empirical rule, then, we know that at least 95% of all possible sample means we could 
select from a population are within two standard deviations (SD) of the population mean.

The standard error of the mean, or standard error, is the standard deviation of a sampling distribution of sample means. 
It is the standard error or distance that sample mean values deviate from the value of the population mean.
