Looking at data...
Frequency: A frequency is the number of times or how often a category, score, or range of scores occurs.
Frequency distributions summarize how often (or frequently) scores occur in a data set.

Simple frequency distribution is when we see how often a certain score is produced or how often they occur in defining groups.

There are steps you have to go through in order to construct something like this:
	Find the real range
		One more between the difference of the largest and smallest number.
	Find the interval width
		Equation:    real range/number of desired intervals
		If this interval width isn't a whole number, round up
	Construct the frequency distribution
		In a frequency distribution, the interval boundaries mark the cutoffs 
		for a given interval. The lower boundary is the smallest value in each 
		interval, and the upper boundary is the largest value in each interval.
Grouped data is just data that's dropped into each of these intervals.

When you have outliers towards one way or another in the data set, you will often see that the data is dropped when
expressing one way or another.
An open interval, or open class, is an interval with no defined upper or lower boundary. 
Outliers are extreme scores that fall substantially above or below most of the scores in a particular data set.

The cumulative frequency distribution describes the sum of scores across each range and always sums to the total 
number of scores in a distribution.
For instance, in a table with restaurants with certain amount of complaints, you could add bottom up to a certain point. Then
you would stop at the threshold for it being called safe, then say "x amount of restaurants are considered safe".

Relative frequency is when you take the amount of instances per interval and divide them by the total amount of 
instances in the entire data set. The sum of all the of relative frequencies equals 1. Relative percent is just this.

The cumulative relative frequency is just adding the relative frequencies up like you would with the cumulative frequencies.

A percentile, specifically a percentile point, is the value of an individual or a score within a larger distribution. 
The corresponding percentile of a percentile point is the percentile rank of that score.

Cumulative percent distribution is the same as cumulative frequency. Sum across intervals.

Frequency distributions for ungrouped data

This is when you have something that's got such a small difference, that you don't create intervals. You just want to
demonstrate general trends elsewhere.

Let's say in a study where there's only 3 responses, you don't wanna put this into a chart like you were in previous 
chapters. This is called ungrouped data.
Ungrouped data are a set of scores or categories distributed individually, where the frequency for 
each individual score or category is counted.

Pictorial frequency distributions
Pictograms: just pictures that are being used as graphs. Summary display or illusions to explain
data with pictures.

Can display data with more than just a table.

Histograms -> just x-y plots of a graph, often with a common line linking all of the.
To construct a histogram, we have three rules we have to follow.
You make them in SPSS all the time.
Summarizes the frequencies of continious data that are quantitative

Frequency polygon is a dot and line graph that's then connected to each other
It connects at the midpoint of each interval in the graph.

Ogives
Dot and liine graph used to sum cumulative percentages. Same as frequency polygon, but used 
to map the cumulative percentages at their upper boundry of each interval.

Stem and Leaf displays
Maps each individual data point on a graph. Useful for small sets of data.

Graphing distributions: discreete and categorical data

Discrete data: something you call one at a time. Discrete and categorical
data are often graph different from continuous data because the data
is measured in whole units.

Bar charts are like histograms, but the bars don't touch each other.
List the categories along the X axis, and along the Y axis list the
frequencies.

Pie charts show distributions of data as relative percents. each part of a
pie chart is made up of a sector.

bad charts lead to bad intepretations of data. Look for
1. unlabeled displays
2. misaltered axis
3. display in which the vertical axis doesn't begin with 0
