Central tendencies

3.1, 3.2
----
Class average is the most obvious example of central tendencies.

N is the denotation for entire population size
n is the denotation for the size of the sample from the population

Mean, median, mode
Mean -> average
Median -> middle number in set. 
Mode -> highest frequencies

The mean for entire population is called population mean, sample mean is also a thing for 
when you just take from the sample. The mean is the balance point of data sets.

Weighted mean is when you take the mean of a sample of scores. say you have a dataset, 
you split it in two. The larger the sample size, the more likely the mean
is going to be useful in your interpretation of the data.
Use the weighted mean when you have multiple groups of data to score,
and want to combine them all together.

Median is best used when you have an insane amount of outliers, and want to find the general
tendency in the group. 1, 1,1,1,1, and 10000000 will have a crazy high mean, but the central
tendency is not that at all.
You get the median number from an even amount of numbers by simply taking the two middle numbers and then averaging them together.

The mode reflects the most repeated piece of data. Works well in non-numeric datapoints.

Characteristics of the mean

When you change an existing score, you will also change the mean. If you add a new score or remove
a score, it will also change the mean. This is simple! Just depends on what you are deleting from the dataset.

If you do something to every number in the dataset, you also do that to the mean.
Changing each score in a distribution by the same constant will likewise change the mean by that constant.

To show how far something deviates from a mean, you take the datapoint, subtract the mean from it, then square it. Then
you sum it. This shows ur deviation from the mean.

Choosing an appropriate measure of CT. In order to select the right way 
to examine data, you want to do so based on the scale of measurement and the
central tendancy.

The mean is typically used to describe interval and ratio scale data that are normally distributed.
The skew of a set of data can go one way or another based on the skew in comparison to the mean. This is when
the median would be better used.
In a positively skewed distribution, the mean is greater than the mode; in a negatively skewed distribution, 
the mean is less than the mode.

The median is used to display direction in a set of ordinal data. You can't use the mean or mode. They;re useless.

There's a few types of modes.
Unimodal distributions have a single mode in the dataset.
Modal distribution is when multiple scores are the mode.

The mode is used to show tendency in nominal data.
